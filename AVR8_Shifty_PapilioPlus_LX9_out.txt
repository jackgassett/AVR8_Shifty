INFO:Xst:2117 - HDL ADVISOR - Mux Selector <MstSMSt_Current> of Case statement line 321 was re-encoded using one-hot encoding. The case statement will be optimized (default statement optimization), but this optimization may lead to design initialization problems. To ensure the design works safely, you can:
   	- add an 'INIT' attribute on signal <MstSMSt_Current> (optimization is then done without any risk)
   	- use the attribute 'signal_encoding user' to avoid onehot optimization
   	- use the attribute 'safe_implementation yes' to force XST to perform a safe (but less efficient) optimization

WARNING:MapLib:1182 - One or more latches or registers which have both an active
   asynchronous set and reset have been found in the design. To get this same
   functionality in the spartan6 architecture a sub-optimal circuit must be
   created in terms of area, power and performance. Therefore it is highly
   suggested to either remove one set or reset or make the function synchronous

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

INFO:Xst:2117 - HDL ADVISOR - Mux Selector <MstSMSt_Current> of Case statement line 321 was re-encoded using one-hot encoding. The case statement will be optimized (default statement optimization), but this optimization may lead to design initialization problems. To ensure the design works safely, you can:
   	- add an 'INIT' attribute on signal <MstSMSt_Current> (optimization is then done without any risk)
   	- use the attribute 'signal_encoding user' to avoid onehot optimization
   	- use the attribute 'safe_implementation yes' to force XST to perform a safe (but less efficient) optimization

Mapping design into LUTs...
WARNING:MapLib:1182 - One or more latches or registers which have both an active
   asynchronous set and reset have been found in the design. To get this same
   functionality in the spartan6 architecture a sub-optimal circuit must be
   created in terms of area, power and performance. Therefore it is highly
   suggested to either remove one set or reset or make the function synchronous
   in order to obtain a more optimal implementation in this architecture.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.

Timing Score: 0 (Setup: 0, Hold: 0, Component Switching Limit: 0)

Number of Timing Constraints that were not applied: 1

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
